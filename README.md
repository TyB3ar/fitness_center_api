This is my submission for the Module 6 Lesson 2 assingment. 

In this flask app, there are several methods to:
- Retrieve all members from the database (GET) 
- Retrieve select members from the database (GET) 
- Add a new member to the databse (POST)
- Update member info (PUT)
- Delete a member (DELETE)

As can also be seen, there are several error handling methods to verify if member id's are present, if there is incorrect input, and if certain members are connected to a workout session. 

The code is also written based off of my own 'Fitness_Center' database, so database information will need to be entered in the 'get_database' function for testing. 

Thanky you!
